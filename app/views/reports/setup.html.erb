    Welcome to your Tronc System.com! This application will help you to manage your tronc system. <br>The system assumes that you will pay tips to staff on a weekly basis and pay HMRC on a monthly basis (contact support for a special setup if this is not the case)
  </p>
  <hr>
  <% if current_user.employees.length == 0 %>
    <p>
      In order to get started you will need to add some staff to your system. After you have done this, you will be returned here to finish setting up your system.
    </p>
    <%= link_to "Employees Area", employees_path, class: 'btn btn-primary btn-lg' %>
  <% else %>
    <p>
      Now that you've added your employees, you need to create your first Tronc Report. This could be for this month, or you can go back to the beginning of the tax year and enter in all your previous weekly records!
